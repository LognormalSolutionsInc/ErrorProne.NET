- Warn if readonly struct is passed by ref (should be info message).
- Implement: pass parameter by 'in' refactoring.
- Cache non-source types for IsReadOnly.
- Large struct used in many methods? Stateful analysis is required.
- Hidden copy: when an extension method is used that takes a struct by value.
- Equals and gethashcode are asymmetrical (different props/fields are used). (not sure about that)

Known limitations
- Generic instantiations are not analyzed: public void Foo<T>(in T t) {} Foo<NonReadOnly>(); <-- no warning now.

Infrastructure
- Create one solution
- Create
  - Core (move helpers here)
  - Structs
  - Memory
  - Misc (various analyzers)
  - Exceptions
